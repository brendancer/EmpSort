An example of a searchable, filterable employee directory. I'm using random users from randomuser.me to seed my table

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

You can alphabetically sort the directory by first name, last name, city or state. You can also filter the directory to find an employee by first or last name.
